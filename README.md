# CC Switch Web

English | [中文](README_ZH.md) | [日本語](README_JA.md)

## Overview

CC Switch Web is the web branch repository of [cc-switch](https://github.com/farion1231/cc-switch).

This repository is used to carry web-oriented work around CC Switch, including web-side implementation, related experiments, and branch-specific adjustments.

The current target architecture is:

- Frontend: Web
- Backend: local Rust service
- Access pattern: browser opens `http://localhost:xxxx`

This direction targets Windows, macOS, Linux, and headless Linux server environments.

## Version

The current repository version is `0.1.3`.

This repository now treats `0.1.0` as its initial Web release baseline. Previous inherited release history has been removed from this repository and should be considered part of the upstream project history.

## Run

### Quick Commands

| Scenario | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Local development (`w`) | `pnpm dev` |
| Docker foreground development (`d`) | `pnpm dev -- d` |
| Local release build (`w`) | `pnpm build` |
| Docker image build (`d`) | `pnpm build -- d` |
| Project check | `pnpm check` |
| Export artifacts on Windows | `.\scripts\package-artifacts.ps1 [all|w|l|d]` |

### Local Development

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
   ```

   Rust `1.88+` is required for the backend build and check steps.

2. Start development mode:

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

   Equivalent explicit form:

   ```bash
   pnpm dev -- w
   ```

   On Windows, you can also run:

   ```powershell
   .\scripts\dev.ps1 w
   ```

   To pin ports explicitly, you can run:

   ```bash
   pnpm dev -- --frontend-port 3300 --backend-port 8890
   pnpm dev -- w -f 3300 -b 8890 --host 127.0.0.1
   ```

   On Windows:

   ```powershell
   .\scripts\dev.ps1 w -f 3300 -b 8890
   ```

3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). The frontend connects to the local Rust service at `http://127.0.0.1:8890`.
   In local development, open the frontend dev URL instead of the backend port. `pnpm dev` disables backend static frontend hosting by default, and when a preferred port is unavailable it automatically scans forward and wires the final backend address into Vite.

4. `pnpm dev` enables local request debug logs by default:
   - Browser DevTools show frontend request/response logs
   - The Rust service terminal shows Web API method/path/status/duration logs
   - You can override this with `VITE_RUNTIME_DEBUG_REQUESTS=0|1` and `CC_SWITCH_WEB_DEBUG_API=0|1`

### Local Release Binary

1. Build the embedded release binary:

   ```bash
   pnpm build
   ```

   Equivalent explicit form:

   ```bash
   pnpm build -- w
   ```

   On Windows, you can also run:

   ```powershell
   .\scripts\build.ps1 w
   ```

2. Output path:

   - Windows: `backend\target\release\cc-switch-web.exe`
   - Linux/macOS: `backend/target/release/cc-switch-web`

3. Run the binary directly, then open the final address printed in the terminal. The frontend static assets and Web API share the same service port. The default preferred port is `8890`:

   ```bash
   ./backend/target/release/cc-switch-web --backend-port 8890
   ```

   Windows:

   ```powershell
   .\backend\target\release\cc-switch-web.exe -b 8890
   ```

   If the preferred port is already in use, excluded by the OS, or denied by local policy, the service automatically scans forward and prints the actual port it bound to.

4. In local Web service mode, CC Switch Web stores its own data under the default CC Switch local config root:

   ```text
   ~/.cc-switch
   ```

   This includes files such as `settings.json`, `cc-switch.db`, backup data, and the unified Skills storage. Legacy `config.json` is not part of the active Web runtime data path.

### Docker

1. Build the Docker image:

   ```bash
   pnpm build -- d
   ```

   On Windows, you can also run:

   ```powershell
   .\scripts\build.ps1 d
   ```

2. Run the Docker stack in the foreground:

   ```bash
   pnpm dev -- d
   ```

   On Windows, you can also run:

   ```powershell
   .\scripts\dev.ps1 d
   ```

   To override the exposed service port:

   ```bash
   CC_SWITCH_WEB_PORT=8895 pnpm dev -- d
   ```

   PowerShell:

   ```powershell
   $env:CC_SWITCH_WEB_PORT=8895; .\scripts\dev.ps1 d
   ```

3. If you want background mode after the image is built, use Docker directly:

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   docker compose logs -f
   docker compose down
   ```

4. Open [http://localhost:8890](http://localhost:8890) or your overridden port. The container serves the embedded frontend and API on the same port. Docker mode keeps `CC_SWITCH_WEB_PORT_SCAN_COUNT=1` by default so that published port mappings stay stable. Persistent data is stored in the `cc-switch-web-data` volume.

5. If you want the containerized service to manage host-side CLI config directories directly, first copy the example file:

   ```bash
   cp docker-compose.host.example.yml docker-compose.host.yml
   ```

   Then adjust the paths for your machine and run:

   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.host.yml up -d
   ```

   The example file is primarily for Linux servers and uses `$HOME` paths for `.claude`, `.codex`, `.gemini`, `.config/opencode`, and `.config/openclaw`.

### Export Linux Package Inside Docker

If you want a Linux release package without polluting the host build environment, use Docker Buildx directly:

```bash
docker buildx build --target package-linux-tar --output type=local,dest=release/docker-linux .
```

Exported archive:

```text
release/docker-linux/cc-switch-web-linux-x64.tar.gz
```

If you want the unpacked directory instead:

```bash
docker buildx build --target package-linux-dir --output type=local,dest=release/docker-linux .
```

Exported directory:

```text
release/docker-linux/cc-switch-web-linux-x64/
```

The package contains the single executable `cc-switch-web`. After extracting on Linux, run that binary directly.

The exported Linux binary is built as `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`, which reduces host-side runtime dependency issues.

### Export Artifacts On Windows

If you are working on Windows and already have Rust plus Docker/Buildx installed locally, run:

```powershell
.\scripts\package-artifacts.ps1
```

Without arguments, the script exports all three local artifacts:

- Windows executable: `release\local-artifacts\windows\cc-switch-web.exe`
- Linux release package: `release\local-artifacts\linux\cc-switch-web-linux-x64.tar.gz`
- Docker image archive: `release\local-artifacts\docker\cc-switch-web-docker-image.tar.gz`

It also supports single-target export modes:

- `.\scripts\package-artifacts.ps1 w`
  - Export only the Windows executable
- `.\scripts\package-artifacts.ps1 l`
  - Export only the Linux release package
- `.\scripts\package-artifacts.ps1 d`
  - Export only the Docker image archive

Details:

- The Windows artifact comes from local `cargo build --locked --release`
- The Linux artifact comes from Docker Buildx using the `package-linux-tar` stage
- The Docker image archive can be imported with:

```powershell
docker load -i .\release\local-artifacts\docker\cc-switch-web-docker-image.tar.gz
```

### Linux systemd Example

If you want to keep the service running on a headless Linux server, use:

`deploy/systemd/cc-switch-web.service.example`

Recommended steps:

1. Build the release binary on Linux, or copy a packaged Linux artifact into `/opt/cc-switch-web`.

2. Copy the service file into the system directory:

   ```bash
   sudo cp deploy/systemd/cc-switch-web.service.example /etc/systemd/system/cc-switch-web.service
   ```

3. Adjust these fields for your machine:
   - `User`
   - `Group`
   - `WorkingDirectory`
   - `HOME`
   - `ExecStart`

4. Reload and start:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   sudo systemctl enable --now cc-switch-web
   ```

5. Check status and logs:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status cc-switch-web
   sudo journalctl -u cc-switch-web -f
   ```
